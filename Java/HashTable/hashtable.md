# Hashtables
### Data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.



## Challenge
### Write code to implement the hashtable methods to store and retrieve data in time complexity O(1) and a Space Complexity of O(1)



## Approach & Efficiency
## Apply this methods:

* add() Takes in both the key and value. This method hashes the key, and adds the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
* get() Takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
* contains() Takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
* keySet() Takes key and returns an index in the collection.
