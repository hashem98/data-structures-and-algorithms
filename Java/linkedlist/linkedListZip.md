### merge two linked list into one but we will take one index from each one each time we merge
---

## Whiteboard Process
![Linked List Insertions](../asset/zip.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
### the zip method will  receive two linked list and create two temporary referances and new linked list to add values to it then  loop while the two temporary referances is not null so check the first one if not null we will add its value to our new linked lis then assign the TempRef one to next node same for the second check finally return merged linked list
