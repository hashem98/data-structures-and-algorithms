# Challenge Summary
>> write the Breadth-First-Traversal method on Graph.
## Whiteboard Process
![BFS](../asset/GraphBFS.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
>> Add a breadth-first method to your graph object that receives a beginning node. Return a collection of nodes in the order they were visited without using any of your built-in functions. 

### Efficiency
>> breadthTraverse: Time: O(n^2) worst case where n is the number of nodes in the graph of a Complete Graphs , Space: O(n) n is the number of nodes
